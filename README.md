# Sisma's Microtonal synth

A VST subtractive synth that allows you to fine-tune each scale degree. <br>
Programmed in C++ using the JUCE library.

#### **WARNING!!!** <br>
This app was made using JUCE v6.0.5. <br>
Trying to build the app using the latest JUCE version will probably result in some kind of error. <br>
Also keep in mind that this is my first VST so the source code would not be the cleanest nor the most optimized it can be. <br>
The app has been developed and tested on Windows 10 so i don't know if it works correctly in any other OS.

# Install Dependencies

[Download Juce from here](https://juce.com/get-juce)
  
# Installation

If you want to use the app you can download it by clicking the green button that says "Code" and then clicking at the "Download Zip" option. <br>
Inside the Zip file you will find the "Standalone Plugin" folder and inside that the "Sisma's_Microtonal_Synth.exe" file. By running the .exe file and then activating your MIDI device from the options menu you can start playnig with the plugin. <br>
If you want to use the plugin as a Vst inside the DAW of your choice you can copy and paste the "VST3" folder to the folder that your DAW scans to find Vst's which is normally the "C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3" directory.
