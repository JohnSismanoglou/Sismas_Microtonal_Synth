#### **WARNING!!!** <br>
This app was made using JUCE v6.0.5. <br>
Trying to build the app using the latest JUCE version will probably result in some kind of error. <br>
Also keep in mind that this is my first VST so the source code would not be the cleanest nor the most optimized it can be. <br>
The executable and VST only work on Windows.

# Install Dependencies

[Download Juce from here](https://juce.com/get-juce)
  
# Installation

If you want to use the app you can download it by clicking the green button that says "Code" and then clicking at the "Download Zip" option. <br>
Inside the Zip file you will find the "Sisma's Microtonal Synth (Standalone Executable)" folder and inside that the "Sisma's_Microtonal_Synth.exe" file. By running the .exe file and then activating your MIDI device from the options menu you can start playnig with the plugin. <br>
If you want to use the plugin as a VST inside the DAW of your choice you can copy and paste the "Sisma's Microtonal Synth (VST3)" folder to the folder that your DAW scans to find VST's which is normally in the "C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3" directory.
